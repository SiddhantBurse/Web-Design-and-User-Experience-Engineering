                <p>With a smooth, dense texture and tender cookies, the dairy-free So Delicious sandwich was a favorite
                    among vegan and non-vegan testers alike. However, we must warn you: If you don’t like coconut, you
                    will not like this treat. There’s no escaping that coconut taste, yet we didn’t think it was
                    overpowering. (There’s an almond milk option too, but we didn’t test it.) We would have liked a bit
                    more ice cream in these, since it didn’t stretch to all four corners of the cookies. Then again, we
                    could have eaten this ice cream in pint form and been totally happy.</p>

                <p>We found the soy-based Tofutti Cuties to be the closest to a dairy-style ice cream sandwich in looks
                    and texture. But they just don’t have the same taste: One tester said the flavor was sweet and
                    slightly artificial, and a few others mentioned that these tasted overwhelmingly like cookies
                    . These are a go-to for many vegans, though,
                    since they’re widely available and inexpensive. And they are the only dairy-free sandwiches we tried
                    that don’t include palm oil, which is something people may appreciate due to sustainability issues.
