			<h2>Preparations for international travel</h2>
            <P>International travel doesn’t have to be tricky – just make sure your travel documents and required 
                paperwork are in order. When you travel internationally, you’re responsible to make sure you have the 
                correct documents to enter and pass through any countries during your trip, and then make your way back home.
                <br>
                To start:</P>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everyone traveling, regardless of age, needs their own set of travel documents.</li>
                    <li>Always use the information exactly as it appears on your passport (to book and fill out any documents).</li>
                    <li>Check with the consulate of every country you’re entering (or passing through) to make sure you meet all travel requirements.</li>
                    <li>Some countries require proof of return or onward travel, a visiting address and sufficient funds for your stay.</li>
                  </ul>

			<h2>Passport</h2>
			
			<p>A passport is required for all international travel
                <strong>If you're traveling anywhere overseas</strong>,
                you need a passport to board an international flight and to enter the country. 
                Passport cards will not be accepted as form of I.D. for international air travel.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some countries require your passport to be issued at least 6 months before the day you arrive. 
                        Check your destination’s requirements if you’re unsure. </li>
                    <li>Passports must be kept in good condition, free of any damage beyond normal wear and tear, and material alterations. 
                        You may be denied boarding if you travel with a passport that appears damaged or altered.</li>
